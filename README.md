Hi! I'm a current graduate student in Applied Statistics and Data Science with experience in Python, R, SQL, machine learning, and natural language processing.
I'm passionate about learning and exploring the connections between data, AI, audio, and all forms of entertainment.
I enjoy discovering new music and films and seeing how media can bring people together and influence the world.
I am also interested in explainability, continuous learning, and how people engage with subjects like mathematics.
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work on a project together!
